# How to stake MATIC tokens on Polygon

### Prerequisites:

Before continuing with this guide please be sure that:

- **You have a [Crypto wallet](Cryptowallets.md)**
- **You have [MATIC tokens](How_to_get_Crypto_tokens.md) in your wallet**
- **You know what [staking](What_is_staking.md) is.**
- **You understand [the risks](Risks_of_staking.md) involved with staking**

***

### **1.  Go to the [Polygon staking page](https://wallet.polygon.technology/staking/)**

Which you can easily access by clicking this link: [Stake MATIC](https://wallet.polygon.technology/staking/)

![Staking page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95366163/147950236-21ba20bd-7a8a-4304-96a0-6b3750ace891.png)


### **2.  Choose AUDIT.one as your validator**

You can either do this by scrolling down in the list until you find our logo or you can type in **AUDIT.one** in the search bar.

Once you've found it, click **Delegate** on the right side:

![Delegete](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95366163/147950366-b96fc8c7-0c42-417e-8f8e-30af44dff60d.png)

If you click on our name in stead of *Delegate* you will be redirected to this page with some additional info on AUDIT.one. <br>

You will not only see things like the **validator fee**, **your own MATIC balance**, the total amount of MATIC **staked with AUDIT.one**, the amount of staked assets that are **selfstaked**, but also the **total amount of rewards** that have been already earned by staking with us. If you're interested you can even see how many delegators are staking with AUDIT.one and how much they are staking. <br>

Once you're happy with what you see, click on **Become a delegator** to continue.

Want to get more info about this commission fee? Go to [what is a validator fee?](Validator_fee.md)<br>


### **3.  Choose the amount you wish to delegete**

Once you've clicked on delegate (or become a delegator), you will see this screen:

You will be asked to put in the amount of XPRT you wish to stake before you can continue. <br>
_(By clicking the word '**MAX**' on the right side of the entry bar, the maximum available amount will be filled in automatically)_

Once you've decided how many tokens you wish to stake, hit the **Continue** button.

***
# Uncomplete

You will be asked to choose the transaction fee (low, average or high). 
The higher the fee you are willing to pay, the faster the transaction will be completed. [Why are there transaction fees?](Transaction_fees.md)

### **Congratulations!** 
You have now succesfully staked your MATIC tokens!


### **4.  Sit back and watch your tokens earn rewards**

Make sure to come back to the [Polygon staking dashboard](https://wallet.polygon.technology/staking/) to see the status of your delegations. <br>

You can claim your pending rewards by clicking on the green **Claim** button on the right side.<br>
These rewards will be added to your total XPRT balance and will be visible as **Delegatable** or **Transferable**. <br>
In other words, you will than be able to stake these rewards once more or transfer to another wallet.
