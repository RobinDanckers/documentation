# Why is it important to choose the right validator?

It might be overwelming when it comes to choosing the right validator to delegate your crypto tokens to as the number of validators keeps growing.
We will try to make that decision a little easier for you by dividing them in different categories. In that way, with a little research of yourself, you can choose the validator that fits your needs!

In general, there are only a few categories to distinct the different types of validators. <br>
Each one of them have there own advantages and disadvantages.

  1. **Fund validators**
  2. **Exchanges**
  3. **Protocol developer validators**
  4. **Pure infrastructure validators**
  5. **Individual validators**


## Fund validators

Fund validators are less important for people who like to stake their tokens as they usually stake their own assets and are not open to delegations. 
You will recognize them when the validator fee is 100%.


## Exchanges

One of the biggest advantages of staking your crypto with exchanges is your own convenience. It is hands down the easiest staking option as you don't need to worry about keeping your private keys somewhere safe or learning about how to stake. There are also very low to no fees to claim your rewards, which by the way are often automatically added to your staked balance. <br>

On the other hand, by depending completely on an exchage for your staking and key managagement, you have higher risk to centralise the network you are staking on, earn possibly lower rewards due to fractional staking and you might lose all your funds when the exchange for exemple gets hacked.


## Protocol developer validators

In addition to offering staking services, protocol developer validators support the development of and actively contribute code to the networks they support. A big advantage of these validators is that they normally have a lot of knowledge about the networks they support they are actively involved in development of it. That is why a part of all staking fees are reinvested in the devellopment of the network.

A potential disadvantage of these validators is that they often support only a limited number of networks due to the time and resources required to be so heavily involved in these networks.


## Pure infrastructure validators 

Pure infrastructure validators, like AUDIT.one support a wide range of Proof of Stake networks. These validators generally are better at comparing differtent networks, do their own research on networks and have a good understanding of the overall development of the Proof-of-Stake ecosystem as a whole.

Because this group of validators support several networks, it may be the case that they are less capable of answering very detailed questions about a specific network in comparison to protocol developer validators.


## Individual Validators

As the name insists, an individual validator typically consists of one to four people and are more focused on one or a small amount of networks. Their smaller size and narrower focus can mean that they are more responsive to the questions and needs of their delegators. They are also very valuable to the decentralization of the network.

A disadvantage of delegating to an individual validator is its less robust support and monitoring when compared to professional validators due to the smaller size of the operation.


## Which type of validator should you choose?

The type of validator you decide to delegate your crypto to will depend on your preferences and what kind of token holder you are. You might find yourself fitting in one particular category but you might perfectly find yourself using different kinds of validators for different networks.

  - Are you in for the short-term and prioritize convenience? <br>
      --> **Go with an exchange.** <br>
  - Do you hold one or two Proof-of-Stake coins you strongly believe in? <br>
      --> **Look for protocol developer validators.** <br>
  - Are you a general supporter of the PoS ecosystem and hold tokens of several different networks? <br>
      --> **Go for pure infrastructure validators.** <br>
  - Is your absolute priority to increase decentralization? <br>
      --> **Try an individual validator.** <br>


> Don't forget to always do your own research before choosing a network and/or validator to delegate your assets to.
