# Why is it important to choose the right validator?

# To be rewriten!

It might be overwelming when it comes to choosing the right validator to delegate your crypto tokens to as the number of validators keeps growing.
We will try to make that decision a little easier for you by dividing them in different categories. In that way, with a little research of yourself, you can choose the validator that fits your needs!

In general, there are only a few categories to distinct the different types of validators. <br>
Each one of them have there own advantages and disadvantages.

  1. **Fund Validators**
  2. **Exchanges**
  3. **Protocol Developer Validators**
  4. **Pure Infrastructure Validators**
  5. **Individual Validators**


## Fund Validators

Fund validators are less important for people who like to stake their tokens as they usually stake their own assets and are not open to delegations. 
You will recognize them when the validator fee is 100%.


## Exchanges

One of the biggest advantages of staking your crypto with exchanges is your own convenience. It is hands down the easiest staking option as you don't need to worry about keeping your private keys somewhere safe or learning about how to stake. There are also very low to no fees to claim your rewards, which by the way are often automatically added to your staked balance. <br>

On the other hand, by depending completely on an exchage for your staking and key managagement, you have higher risk to centralise the network you are staking on, earn possibly lower rewards due to fractional staking and you might lose all your funds when the exchange for exemple gets hacked.


## Protocol Developer Validators

In addition to offering staking services, protocol developer validators support the development of and actively contribute code to the networks they support. A big advantage of these validators is that they normally have a lot of knowledge about the networks they support they are actively involved in development of it. That is why a part of all staking fees are reinvested in the devellopment of the network.

A potential disadvantage of these validators is that they often support only a limited number of networks due to the time and resources required to be so heavily involved in these networks.


## Pure infrastructure validators 

Pure infrastructure validators, like AUDIT.one support a wide range of Proof of Stake networks. These validators generally are better at comparing differtent networks.

have a good understanding of the overall development of the Proof of Stake ecosystem as a whole, which means they tend to be better at comparing different networks, understanding which networks are ahead of others in terms of development, and similar kinds of analysis.
A potential disadvantage of staking with pure infrastructure professional validators is that they may be less capable of answering more focused questions about specific networks, something a protocol developer validator that focuses on just a few networks may be better suited for.
Examples: stakefish, BisonTrails, Staked

Individual Validators
Individual validators are typically made up of one to four people and tend to be intensely focused on one or a small handful of networks. Their small size and narrower focus means they can be more responsive to what their delegators want. They are also extremely valuable to the decentralization of the network.
One potential drawback of delegating to an individual validator is less robust support and monitoring when compared to professional validators due to the smaller size of the operation.
Example: Chainflow

The type of validator you decide to stake your tokens with will ultimately depend on what kind of token holder you are. You might fall squarely into one category, or you might find yourself using different kinds of validators for different networks.
Are you a short-term trader who prioritizes convenience? Go with an exchange.
Do you hold one or two Proof of Stake coins you believe in strongly? Look into protocol developer professional validators.
Are you invested in the Proof of Stake ecosystem as a whole, with holdings across many different networks? Look into pure infrastructure professional validators.
Is increasing decentralization your top priority? Try an individual validator.
